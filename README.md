# Representaton of the input:
Each value will be an integer, representing the lenght of that conection:
- Zero means that the edge is flat
- Positive values means that it sticks out, the larger the value, the longer the stick
- Negative values means that there is a hole, the larger the value, the deeper the hole
A connection can be made if the sum of two edges is less or equal than 0 (in other words, if there is a stick, the stick is shorter or equal to the length of the hole)

The input will be a .dzn file with two fields
An array of 18 numbers called "Border" which details the length of each hole/stick in the border. See from the image `HexNumbering.png` the red dots to see which index corresponds to which position
A matrix of of 7 rows and 6 columns of numbers called "Tiles". The row represents the number of the tile (first row being tile0) with each value inside the row detailing the length of each edge. See `HexNumbering.png` the purple dots to see which index corresponds to which position.

Example of the input:
```
Border = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0];
Tiles =  [|0,0,0,0,0,0,
          |0,0,0,0,0,0,
          |0,0,0,0,0,0,
          |0,0,0,0,0,0,
          |0,0,0,0,0,0,
          |0,0,0,0,0,0,
          |0,0,0,0,0,0|]
```

# Representation of the output:
The output will be represented with three fields
An array of 7 elements called `TileAssignments` which details which tile goes in each position. See from the image `HexNumbering.png` the blue numbers to see what each index corresponds to. Example: Having `TileAssignments=[1,...]` means that tile1 has been placed where the blue 0 is in the image.
An array of 7 elements called `Rotations` which indicates the rotation of the tile on each position. The index corresponds to the position on the board (the blue numbers in the image `HexNumbering.png`) and the value indicates how many times the tile has been rotated 60ยบ anti-clockwise. Another way of viewing it is that whatever edge was on position `value` of the original tile is now oriented on edge 0 of the placed tile (see purple numbers from `HexNumbering.png`)
An array of 7 elements called `Flips` which indicates wheather the tile has been flipped or not (first apply rotation, and THEN apply flip). The index corresponds to the position on the board (the blue numbers in the image `HexNumbering.png`). A value of 0 means it has NOT been flipped, a value of 1 means that is HAS been flipped

Example of the input:
```
TileAssignments = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
Rotations = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Flips = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
```
